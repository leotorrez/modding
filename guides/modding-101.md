# Requirements

In order to start making mods you will need the following:

- [Blender latest LTS(Long Term Support) version](https://blender.org/downloads). 3D modeling software
- An [XXMI Launcher](/guides/getting-started.md) Install with developer mode enabled. This is required to test your mods in the game
- [XXMI Tools](/guides/xxmi_tools.md#installation) plugin for Blender. Plugin to export models for reinjection

## Getting Started with Blender

Blender is quite a powerful and complete tool for 3D modeling, animations, rendering and even video edition. For this reason, it can be a bit overwhelming at first. Before diving into it and start pressing random buttons, it is recommended to go through some basic tutorials to get familiar with the interface and some keybinds.

The channel [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru) on YouTube has an excellent series called "Donut Tutorial." It's a great starting point for beginners, covering Blender basics in a fun and engaging way.

Most of these tutorials cover the export process and explain or showcase it. However, they do not focus on the export tools.
